= Using Predefined Shapes

This topic outlines the support of shapes for the Infragistics Excel Engine and provides a code snippet demonstrating usage.

This topic is organized as follows:

* <<One,Introduction>>
* <<Two,Supported Shape Types>>
* <<Three,Supported Customizations for Shapes>>
* <<Four,Related Topics>>

[[One]]
== Introduction

Microsoft Excel allows a user to use predefined shapes in their worksheets. The Infragistics Excel Engine supports shapes though a collection of shapes which already exists on the worksheet. This feature adds to the existing support by allowing more shape types to be created.
