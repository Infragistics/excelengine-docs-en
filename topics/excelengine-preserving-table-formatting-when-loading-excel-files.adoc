== Introduction

Each table has an associated style which provides default format settings for cells in many different areas of the table. This style is represented by the  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettablestyle_members.html[WorksheetTableStyle]"]  pick:[win-forms-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettablestyle_members.html[WorksheetTableStyle]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettablestyle_members.html[WorksheetTableStyle]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettablestyle_members.html[WorksheetTableStyle]"]  class and is exposed on a table through the `WorksheetTable`  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~style.html[Style]"]  pick:[win-forms-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~style.html[Style]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~style.html[Style]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.documents.excel{ApiVersion}~infragistics.documents.excel.worksheettable~style.html[Style]"]  property. Preserving `WorksheetTableStyles` is supported, so when you are loading Excel files, your table formatting will be preserved.
